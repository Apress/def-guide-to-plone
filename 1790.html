    Code is wrong. The current code reads:
    
	&lt;a href="http://plone.org/Members/andy/book"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;
	
    This should read:
    
	&lt;a href="http://plone.org/Members/andy/book" title="Plone Book"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;               
    Code is wrong. The current code reads:
    
	&lt;a href="#" tal:attributes="href python:request.get('message', 'change', default)" /&gt;
    
    This should read:
    
	&lt;a href="#" tal:attributes="href python:request.get('message', default)" /&gt;
	
    And as a result text is wrong:
    
	"then first value will be used, which is of course change."
    
    Should be:
	
	"then first value will be used, which is of course message."
