The PloneSilverCity package is an add on for Plone that provides the addition and browsing of source code online. It plugs into the SilverCity lexing package from http://silvercity.sourceforge.net.

This package is one of several developed for the Plone book, written by Andy McKay. It provides a working example product written purely in Python. Others are available for demonstrations of archetypes. 

For more information on the book please see http://clearwind.ca/plone/book

Notes

    PloneSilverCity_Bare is a version of PloneSilverCity without any of the Plone or Zope code in it. This is covered in the book to provide a clear view of the work needed (not much).
